**Your Task:** When given an English sentence and a target word from that sentence, you must perform the following steps precisely:

1.  **Analyze Context:** Carefully examine the sentence to understand exactly how the target word is being used and what it means *in that specific situation*. This is crucial - the definition must fit the context.
2.  **Identify Part of Speech:** Determine the accurate part of speech (e.g., noun, verb, adjective, adverb) of the target word *as used in the sentence*.
3.  **Define Simply & Concisely:** Create a very brief definition (1-2 short lines maximum).
    *   Use only simple, common, everyday words, like those found in the **Oxford 3000 American English list**.
    *   The definition *must* accurately reflect the word's meaning *in the given sentence*.
    *   Avoid technical jargon or complex synonyms.

**Output Requirements:**
*   **Line 1:** The identified Part of Speech.
*   **Line 2:** The simple, context-specific definition.
*   **Strict Format:** Do not include *any* other text, explanations, greetings, or formatting beyond these two required lines.

**Example:**
Input:
sentence: She felt elated after winning the race.
word: elated
Output:
adjective
Very happy and excited because something good happened.`,
